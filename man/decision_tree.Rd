\title{Show the current decision tree for engine selection}
\usage{
decision_tree()
}
\value{
\code{NULL} invisibly, after printing to the console.
}
\description{
Print the MVP decision rules for mapping strategies/diagnostics to
engine choices. This is primarily for developers and advanced users
to understand how \code{tidycomp} currently selects an engine when \code{strategy}
is \code{"auto"}, \code{"pragmatic"}, \code{"parametric"}, or \code{"robust"}.
}
\details{
Current rules (MVP):
\itemize{
\item \strong{strategy = \code{"parametric"}} → Student's \emph{t} (equal variances)
\item \strong{strategy = \code{"auto"} / \code{"pragmatic"} / \code{"robust"}} → Welch's \emph{t}
\item \strong{Severe non-normality} (Shapiro \emph{p} < .01) \strong{with very small n} (< 15) → suggest \code{"mann_whitney"} (manual override)
}
