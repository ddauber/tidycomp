\title{Compare multiple engines on the same specification}
\usage{
compare_engines(spec, engines = c("welch_t", "student_t", "mann_whitney"))
}
\arguments{
\item{spec}{A \code{comp_spec} created by \code{\link[=comp_spec]{comp_spec()}} and ready to fit
(roles and outcome type must be set).}

\item{engines}{Character vector of engine IDs to compare. Each must
correspond to a registered engine (see \code{.tidycomp_engines()}).}
}
\value{
A tibble combining tidy results from all requested engines.
}
\description{
Fit the same \code{comp_spec} with several different engines and return
a combined tibble of results. This is useful for quickly seeing how
different inferential approaches (e.g., parametric vs. robust) perform
on the same dataset and roles.
}
\details{
For each engine in \code{engines}, this function:
\enumerate{
\item Clones the input spec and sets the requested engine via \code{set_engine()}.
\item Fits it using \code{\link[=test]{test()}}.
\item Tidies the fitted result into a one-row tibble and adds a column
\code{engine_forced} indicating the engine used.
}

The resulting tibbles are row-bound into a single tibble for comparison.
}
